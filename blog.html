<div class="blog">My journey into tech was years back, after I had just completed my high school level. At the time, I enrolled in a computer training program that focused mainly on basic computer packages.



But then it happened that during the training, I observed an instructor teaching a different computer course to another fellow, as someone who was always eager to learn, I initiated a conversation asking what it was all about, I could remember him mentioning HTML CSS, and JavaScript. We had different conversations about it,  that was more than a decade ago. 



And what followed still amazes me today. I began trying to decode some of the code I had seen and practiced it using Notepad++. I didn’t fully understand what I was doing at the time, but I kept practicing with the little knowledge I had.

I eventually stopped, but somehow life kept reconnecting me with programmers and the tech space. Some years ago during my NYSC program, I made another attempt to return to programming. Although I couldn’t complete it then, the interest never left.



In recent times, I have been fully committed. I have spent days, nights, and sleepless nights studying, coding, debugging, and practicing. Recently, I earned certifications in Responsive Web Design and JavaScript, and I have built strong skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with knowledge of React, SQL, database integration, and UI/UX design. I am currently learning backend development and API integration, and I am on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.



Before diving fully into tech, I worked as a physicist educator. That background helped me develop strong analytical thinking, problem-solving, and research skills, which I now apply to building efficient and user-friendly web solutions. I am also a digital creator, and I bring creativity from my experience in beauty and hair styling, which influences my attention to detail and design thinking.



I am open to web developer, frontend, or entry  full-stack roles, as well as internships, volunteer opportunities, and collaborations where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and grow.</div>
